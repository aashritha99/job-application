# Graphic Designer Job Landing Page – Lead Collection

This project is a **deployed landing page** created to collect applications for a **Graphic Designer / Video Editor role**.  
The focus of this task was **shipping a complete, working product**, not just writing code.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

The goal of this landing page is to simulate a **real hiring funnel** for a creative role.

Instead of building a generic form, I designed this as a **job-focused landing page** to:

- Clearly communicate the role (Graphic Designer / Video Editor)
- Highlight benefits and expectations
- Collect candidate details efficiently
- Store applications securely in a database

## 🧠 Why a Graphic Designer Job Post?

I chose a **Graphic Designer / Video Editor job post** because:

- It aligns naturally with a **landing page + lead collection use case**
- Creative roles benefit from clear visual presentation
- It reflects real-world hiring flows used by startups and agencies
- The form structure (Name, Email, Phone) is realistic and minimal

This allowed me to focus on **clarity, conversion, and shipping**, rather than overengineering.
